# CSharpx
Functional programming and other utilities for C# (_work in progress_).

Every source file contains conditional compilation symbols to change type visibility from public to internal
and set other preferences.

## Either.cs
- **C#** native implementation of F# `Choice` discriminated unions.
- Import only required `Either<T1 ... T7>` type.
